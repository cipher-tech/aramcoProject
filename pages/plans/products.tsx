            text={`In Saudi Aramco our goal is to sell hydrocarbon products in a safe, efficient, and customer focused manner through a talented workforce, adopting latest technology, and effective processes.

            All potential customers are required to sign a sales agreement for purchasing hydrocarbon products. There are different registration and qualification processes depending on a number of factors such as the customerâ€™s facility location, type of product and the intended usage.
            We support the long-term vitality of our commercial ecosystem. In particular, being a catalyst for the development of a Saudi energy services sector helps attract, establish, and promote domestic energy-related industries that are globally competitive.

            We also encourage and support the development of other enterprises that have strategic importance to us. A flourishing commercial and industrial ecosystem in the Kingdom means a more successful Saudi Arabia and a more productive environment for our company.

            Gasoline,
            Crude Oil,
            Sulfur,
